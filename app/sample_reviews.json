          "text": "Love the food and vibe here. My usual location is the one in East Van but I stopped here a few times recently and the food delivered the same big flavour and the staff was also very welcoming. I love how their food combines the flavours of comfort food with healthy wholesome ingredients. They carry baked goods from TurF, many of which also offer a slightly healthier take on traditional baked goods without comprising flavour. And everything is vegan!\nPretty small inside, but I really like the vibe. Somehow it kind of reminds me of a camper, maybe it's the shape... If that's not your thing there's a patio area outside with picnic tables which is also great for soaking in good weather when it's nice out.",

Walked in and out of a few cafes trying to find something I could eat when I stumbled upon Kokomo. \n\nTheir Açai bowl was incredible - a açai berry base with lots of healthy toppings like a GF granola, fruits, seeds and almond butter. Loved it!\n\nAlso ordered a lush green smoothie that was packed with so much goodness. Unfortunately, I couldn't bare the taste of raw concentrated turmeric so I barely drank it. For those who can tolerate strong turmeric, this is probably the drink for you. Although I personally didn't like it, I know this drink is packed with anti inflammatory properties. \n\nLoved the staff. New staff in training and she was wonderful, along with the one who was training her.\n\nCute little place on Commercial. Gotta try their other locations.",

The smoothie had just the right amount of coffee in it without it being overpowering while still being able to taste the other flavours. We were one of the only customers in the store at the time so our food was made fast and efficiently. The person working behind the counter was knowledgable and could recommend very good items on the menu. Would definitely return!",

          "text": "I'm late to trying this place and I rarely eat out, but now treat myself to one of their bowls every week. \n\nI've tried both the Coastal Macro Bowl and the Beet Poke Macro Bowl and I can't tell you which is better. They are both INCREDIBLE. I saw a review saying the coastal macro bowl was out of this world... yep, yep, yep - both bowls are in my opinion, out of this world good. The flavours of each are amazing and the ingredients have always tasted fresh. Neither comes with soy curls so I opt to add those as they are sooooo delicious here. The amount of ingredients is good for the price and there is a lot of different elements to each bowl. I consider it filling for the price and I have a big appetite. I'm not typically a smoothie fan, but I tried the Coffee Crisp smoothie a couple times and it was really good \n\nI highly recommend this place and seriously look forward to my meal here every week... I would honestly eat it every day if I could! You need to try this place and you must try the coast macro or the beet poke bowl with added soy curls!!",

          "text": "This place is great if you're in a rush and are looking for something healthy. I had their beet macro before which was really good, and the two new items I tried this time around were really good as well.\n\nHemp Caesar Salad (5/5)\nThis joins Beetbox and Heirloom as my favourite caesar salads of all time. The dressing is super tasty and the nooch adds a nice umami to it. The greens are fresh and the marinated chickpeas are flavourful. The sunflower crackers are good as well, but not crunchy. I added soy curls to the salad and they were really delicious as well.\n\nCoastal Macro Bowl (4/5)\nThis was pretty good. The dressing was flavourful but I found it a little too salty and there was too little of it. The tempeh was tasty, and the edamame hummus refreshing. The greens were fresh and the squash  soft and sweet. This also came with cucumbers and pickled cabbage.\n\nMac and Cheese (3/5)\nThis was just okay. It was a little boring and bland in terms of flavour, though the sunflower cracker bits on top saved it a little. There was only two tiny piece of broccoli in there and overall I wasn't that impressed with this feature. \n\nIt is a little on the pricey side considering the portions you get, but I'd say it's worth it since the bowls are really colourful and nice to look at, and you feel good after eating them.",

The smoothie came in a tiny cup compared all the competitors on west 4th, which are 50% bigger then this and the roughly the same price. It was more a juice then smoothie and very watery. It was also served to me missing about an inch of smoothie from the top of the cup. It was bad value for money. Although the juice/smoothie was tasty itself, I will just stick to the bowls from now on.",

I'm not on a vegan diet or anything like that, but am always intrigued by new spots.

In my opinion, vegan/superfoods have the reputation for being expensive, but I found the price to be very reasonable considering the location and the portion. I quite enjoyed my laksa, the coconut flavour was prominent and the pickled carrots added a nice contrast. I have not had many vegan food experiences, but this was definitely a positive one!",

Was sad to see my favourite summer salad rolled out and replaced by a quinoa one for the colder months, but hey, life is full of disappointments. I take comfort in the fact that their magical Hemp Caesar seems like a fixed item.\n\nAnother note of support: their lovely staff who have given me everything from tea advice for constipation to free candy on Halloween.

          "text": "So initially I went on the website to check out their menu when a friend mentioned it months ago. As I scrolled down, a woman's butt appeared out of nowhere. Pictures of food, butt, food again. I don't get this. In the era of #MeToo why do advertisers feel that this is necessary to sell  food? Unless it was art? idk...\nSo anyways, jump ahead several months and same friend says we should go here for lunch. I am vegetarian and she always makes an effort to patronize veggie places when we go out to eat. I did not at all link the place with the website I had visited before this. I had one of the Macro bowls. It was amazing. A burst of flavours that medley together in ways I haven't experienced before. They use tempeh and other foods not commonly seen in these parts. I am not really a hummous fan anymore (just from overabusing hummous in my early vegetarian days) but their hummous is the only hummous I will eat these days. Tangy and bsolutely delicious. I have been back 3 times since  that first visit; introducing all my veggie friends to it. I've had both Macro bowls and haven't tried anything else yet but I will make my way through the menu.\nOh and they are also very accommodating. I am doing the low carb thing and they will happily sub out the rice for greens with no extra charges. I very much appreciate this. And they are always friendly.\n Even when I discovered that this is the place with the butt I still go back. Go figure, so much for my principles... But I did leave off 1 star for the butt.",

Certainly will be thinking of this place again when I'm in the area, thank you Kokomo staff! The ginger pickled carrots where really nice \n\nIt was almost uncomfortably warm inside is my only down point. Hopefully that will be fixed in the future.
